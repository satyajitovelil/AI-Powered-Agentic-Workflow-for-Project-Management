 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
5. Prioritize the tasks based on dependencies and critical path.
Worker Agent Response:
When prioritizing development tasks based on dependencies and critical path, it is important to identify tasks that are dependent on each other and those that are critical to the overall project timeline. Tasks that have dependencies on other tasks should be prioritized higher to ensure that they are completed before their dependent tasks can begin. Additionally, tasks that are critical to the project timeline, meaning they have the potential to delay the entire project if not completed on time, should also be prioritized higher. By focusing on these tasks first, you can help ensure that the project stays on track and meets its deadlines.
